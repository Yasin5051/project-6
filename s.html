            <b>Cricket</b>
            <article>
                Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field
                is oval with a
                rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04
                metres) wide. Two
                sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of
                each wicket lie
                horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn is
                called an “innings”
                (always plural). Sides have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match,
                the object
                being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit)
                the wicket with
                the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out.
                A bowler
                delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side
                bowls six balls to
                the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.
